  <h4><a href="/collections/treasures">Treasures of the Library</a></h4>

  <p>The University of Manchester's Special Collections of rare
  books, manuscripts, archives, visual materials and maps are an
  outstanding research resource across many disciplines.</p>

  <p>They span 5,000 years and six continents, and include almost
  every format ever used for written communication - from papyrus
  to pixels.</p>

  <cite>Many of the items derive from the superlative collections
  purchased by Enriqueta Rylands for the magnificent library she
  founded as a memorial to her husband John. But the collections
  continue to expand, through purchase, gift and bequest, as we
  respond to new areas of research and build upon existing
  strengths.</cite>
