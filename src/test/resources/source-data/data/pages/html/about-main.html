<h2>Our mission, our vision, our values</h2>

<p>Manchester Digital Collections supports The University of Manchester’s
mission to advance education, knowledge and wisdom for the good of society.</p>

<p>The University’s vision is to be recognised globally for the excellence
of our people, research, learning and innovation,
and for the benefits we bring to society and the environment.</p>

<p>The ongoing development of Manchester Digital Collections is underpinned by five core values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Audience Focus</b> – we believe in an audience-focussed rather
  than technology-driven approach, putting the needs of our audiences first.</li>

  <li><b>Collaboration</b> – we are developing MDC in a collaborative,
  collegial way, as a partnership between University of Manchester researchers,
  IT Services, University of Manchester Libraries, Cultural Institutions, and external stakeholders.</li>

  <li><b>Open Access and Open Data</b> – there should be minimal barriers to access
  (subject to copyright and Data Protection restrictions),
  and we encourage others to reuse and build on our content.</li>

  <li><b>Discoverability and Ease of Use</b> – it should be it as easy as possible for users to discover our content,
  by making MDC’s functionality and accessibility as straightforward as possible.</li>

  <li><b>Citation</b> – it should be easy for users to cite specific content, using stable, time-stamped URLs.</li>
</ul>
