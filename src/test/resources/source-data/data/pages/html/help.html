<p>The right panel, which shows some information about the
    item can be collapsed by clicking on the arrow icon in the far
    right of the screen. This will allow you to view more of the
    image while you can still page forward and backwards through the
    book. There is also a button within the viewer that allows you to
    expand it to cover the full screen.</p>

</p>

<p>When you are looking at an item, on the right hand panel
    select 'View more options' then 'Download or Share'. Under the
    Share section on this tab are there are icons which will let you
    share the page on facebook, twitter and a number of other social
    media sites.</p>

    We aim to use primarily open source technologies, and to avoid
    the use of plugins to make the site accessible to as many people
    as possible. For the website we use a collection of JavaScript
    libraries including <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/"
                           target="_blank">OpenSeadragon</a> for the zoomable images, <a
        href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
    and <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a>.
    Behind the scenes we use <a href="http://xtf.cdlib.org/"
                                target="_blank"> the eXtensible Text Framework (XTF)</a> and <a
        href="http://www.goobi.org/" target="_blank">Goobi</a> for
    digitising and indexing the data. The website was created by the
    digital library team at Cambridge University Library and is
    written in Java. You can find out more by contacting the Digital
    Library Team (see our <a href="/contributors/">Contributors
    Page</a> for details on how to do this).

    We are currently working on implementing the IIIF technology to expand
    your experience using Cambridge Digital Library. If you want to know more
